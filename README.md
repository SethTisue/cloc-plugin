some sloppy code I kludged together so we can use it to get a count
of lines of code compiled in the
[Scala community build](https://github.com/scala/community-builds)

context: https://github.com/scala/community-builds/issues/59

# Issues?

I've disabled the issues in this repo since I don't expect the code will be used in any other context but the community build, which has its own [issues](https://github.com/scala/community-builds/issues)
